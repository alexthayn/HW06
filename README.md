# HW06
Write a WPF application with an Image control, a range control (slider bar, etc.), a calendar control.  The source of the image should come from a resource file.

Use the MVVM pattern separating out your logic/behavior into a ViewModel with properties bound to the UI controls.

Have passing unit tests for (at least some of) the behavior in your ViewModel.
